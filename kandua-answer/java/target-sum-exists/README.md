# Target Sum Exists

### Background

### Determining if a Target Sum Exists

We want to build an algorithm that takes a list of numbers and a target value,
and can well us whether or not it's possible that two numbers in the list sum up
to the requested target.

```c#
TargetSumExistsInTwoNumbers([10, 20], 30) // true
TargetSumExistsInTwoNumbers([10, 20], 35) // false
```

Keep in mind that a number from the list may be used twice

```c#
TargetSumExistsInTwoNumbers([10, 20], 40) // true
```

### Getting Started

The file you will be editing is `Main.java`. Immplement `TargetSumExistsInTwoNumbers` so that all the Asserts evaluate successfully. 


### Second Challenge


Once you have `TargetSumExistsInTwoNumbers` passing the first few tests, see if
you can make use of it to complete `TargetSumExistsInThreeNumbers`.
